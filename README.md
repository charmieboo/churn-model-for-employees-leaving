# Introduction
Employee turnover can be a costly challenge for any organization, leading to disruptions in operations, lower productivity, and the need for frequent recruitment. To mitigate this, a churn model can help predict which employees are most at risk of leaving the company, allowing HR departments to take proactive steps to retain talent. This project explores the development of a churn prediction model using machine learning algorithms, with a focus on identifying key factors influencing employee turnover and guiding the creation of targeted retention programs.

# Project Goals
Identify At-Risk Employees: Use machine learning models to predict which employees may be considering leaving the company.
Understand Turnover Drivers: Analyze data to uncover factors contributing to employee churn, such as job satisfaction, number of projects, working hours, and department.
Enhance Retention Strategies: Use insights from the churn model to inform HR policies and develop programs that improve employee satisfaction and retention.

# Data Overview
The dataset used for this project consists of several key employee metrics:
* Satisfaction Level: Employeeâ€™s self-reported job satisfaction.
* Last Evaluation: Performance score from the most recent evaluation.
* Number of Projects: Total number of projects the employee has worked on.
* Average Monthly Hours: Average number of hours worked per month.
* Time Spent at Company: Number of years the employee has worked at the company.
* Work Accident: Whether the employee has experienced a work-related accident.
* Promotion in Last 5 Years: Whether the employee was promoted in the last five years.
* Department: The department the employee works in (e.g., IT, Sales, Technical, etc.).
* Salary: The salary level of the employee (Low, Medium, High).
The target variable is Quit_the_Company, indicating whether the employee left the company.
